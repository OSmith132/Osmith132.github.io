            <p>FeedTrac is a web-based feedback tracking application developed for academic institutions. It allowed
                students to submit detailed feedback reports, including urgency, tags, and descriptions, which could
                then be accessed by relevant staff members for review in an orderly and efficient manner.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The project was developed as a part of a team using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b> for
                the frontend, while the backend was built in <b>PHP</b> with MariaDB managing the database. Development
                took place locally on an Apache server using the <b>XAMPP</b> software package.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I Primarily served as a backend developer, but remained adaptable as to support frontend development and
                avoid workflow delays. Key responsibilities included designing the database schema, optimizing queries,
                and creating multiple MVC classes to manage database interactions. Additionally, I developed
                comprehensive unit tests for each class to ensure functionality, quality, and maintainability of the
                codebase.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Key skills required for this project included <b>full-stack web development</b>, <b>relational database
                    creation/management</b>, version control with <b>GitHub</b>, and team collaboration using <b>AGILE
                    methodologies</b> to manage workflow and meet deadlines. </p>

        <div class="index-main-showcase-textbox">
            <p>The Graph Theory Interactive Sandbox (GTIS) is a software application developed in <b>Java</b> using
                <b>LibGDX's Scene 2D</b> for an graphical interface and <b>Gradle</b> for efficient build automation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This application was created to produce interactive visualizations of complex <b>network algorithms</b>
                such as <b>Dijkstra's Algorithm</b> and <b>Critical Path Analysis (CPA)</b>. It serves as an educational
                tool designed enhancing student's understanding of algorithmic processes by enabling them to execute
                various algorithms on custom-built graphs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Developing this application required a <b>strong foundation in network theory</b> and a deep
                understanding of commonly used algorithms, such as <b>shortest path algorithms</b>, <b>spanning
                    trees</b>, and <b>critical path methods</b>. Additionally, knowledge of graph structures,
                optimization techniques, and their practical applications was essential for implementing efficient and
                accurate visualizations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I developed this project <b>independently</b> to address the distinct lack of resources available for
                students to understand and practice the graph optimisation algorithms, as outlined in the A-Level
                Further Maths specification.</p>

            <p>Completed during my second year of university, this UX design project involved creating an innovative,
                user-centered system based on a given theme. </p>
            <br>
            <p>My work was recognized for its <b>creative concept</b>, <b>detailed personas</b>, and <b>user
                    scenarios</b>, supported by <b>well-referenced literature</b> to justify design decisions. The final
                design was praised for its <b>high usability</b>, with a <b>well-executed heuristic evaluation</b> and
                <b>multiple rounds of user testing and feedback</b>, driving iterative improvements throughout the
                process.</p>
            <br>

        <div class="index-main-showcase-textbox">
            <p>Developed in <b>NetLogo</b> for my second-year AI module. This project is an advanced Snake game
                demonstrating multiple dynamic <b>pathfinding algorithms</b>. The game includes unique challenges such
                as simultaneous snake players, walls, and various customization features.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Key features include customizable settings for player count, food quantity, and win conditions, along
                with 9 selectable control methods or pathfinding algorithms used by the snakes to navagate the
                environment. These options allow for dynamic experimentation with different <b>AI-driven behaviors</b>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The player also has the option to load in their own custom maps from local CSV files. These files can be
                created and exported via the map editor to the right side of the game window. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The algorithms in this game incluede those such as <b>A*</b>, <b>Uniform-Cost</b>, and <b>greedy
                    searches</b>, as well as the options for human controlled snaked through the use of either the
                keyboard or mouse location. All of these <b>algorithms can be ran simultaneously</b> using multiple
                snakes and with the option to <b>visually display the algorithm steps in real time</b>. I chose to
                include a slider that allows the user to manually adjust the weighting of greedyness when calculating
                the path of the A* algorithm and allow for experimentation</p>
            <br>
            <p>This project required a <b>strong understanding of AI algorithms</b>, particularly <b>A*</b>, <b>greedy
                    searchM</b>, and <b>random walk techniques</b>, as well as effective <b>multi-agent simulation</b>.
