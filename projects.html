            <p>This dissertation project develops an AI-driven <b>semantic segmentation model</b> for 
            <b>2D dental radiographs</b>, designed to automatically identify and categorise dental structures such as 
            <b>lesions</b>, <b>fillings</b>, <b>implants</b>, and <b>braces</b>. By automating the analysis of dental images, 
            the system aims to improve <b>diagnostic efficiency</b> and provide a reliable tool for dental professionals, 
            reducing clinical workload and supporting more consistent imaging interpretation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Initially, the project explored implementing a modified <b>U-Net architecture</b>, which is widely used in 
            <b>medical image analysis</b>. However, recent advances in <b>transfer learning</b> and the release of 
            large-scale pre-trained segmentation models prompted a shift towards adapting <b>foundation models</b> such as 
            <b>SAM</b> and <b>MedSAM</b>. These models were fine-tuned to a <b>domain-specific dental dataset</b>, with 
            extensive use of <b>data augmentation</b> and <b>cross-validation</b> to ensure model robustness and 
            generalisation across diverse imaging conditions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The research investigates whether <b>domain adaptation</b> of pre-trained vision models can provide accurate, 
            generalisable segmentation for clinical environments while maintaining the high reliability required in 
            healthcare. Rigorous evaluation was carried out using metrics such as <b>Dice</b>, <b>IoU</b>, <b>Precision</b>, 
            <b>Recall</b>, and <b>MCC</b>, offering both overall and per-class analysis. This evaluation demonstrated 
            strong segmentation performance, efficient inference, and promising clinical applicability.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ultimately, this project highlights the potential of <b>AI</b> and <b>deep learning</b> to address 
            rising demand for <b>dental radiography analysis</b>, improve <b>diagnostic accessibility</b>, and reduce 
            resource limitations in both <b>clinical</b> and <b>remote healthcare settings</b>.</p>

            <p>The Graph Theory Interactive Sandbox (GTIS) is a software application developed in <b>Java</b> using 
                <b>LibGDX's Scene 2D</b> for a graphical interface and <b>Gradle</b> for efficient build automation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This application was created to produce interactive visualisations of complex <b>network algorithms</b> such as 
                <b>Dijkstra's Algorithm</b> and <b>Critical Path Analysis (CPA)</b>. It serves as an educational tool designed 
                to enhance students' understanding of algorithmic processes by enabling them to execute various algorithms on 
                custom-built graphs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Developing this application required a <b>strong foundation in network theory</b> and a deep understanding of

                created and exported via the map editor on the right side of the game window.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The algorithms in this game include <b>A*</b>, <b>Uniform-Cost</b>, and <b>greedy 
                searches</b>, as well as options for human-controlled snakes through the use of either the 
                keyboard or mouse. All of these <b>algorithms can be run simultaneously</b> using multiple 
                snakes, with the option to <b>visually display the algorithm steps in real time</b>. I included 
                a slider that allows the user to manually adjust the weighting of greediness when calculating 
                the path of the A* algorithm, enabling further experimentation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This project required a <b>strong understanding of AI algorithms</b>, particularly <b>A*</b>, <b>greedy 
                search</b>, and <b>random walk techniques</b>, as well as effective <b>multi-agent simulation</b>.
